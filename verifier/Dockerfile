# Using rust:bookworm so that the builder image has OpenSSL 3.0 which is required by async-tungstenite, because
#
# (1) async-tungstenite dynamically links to the OS' OpenSSL by using openssl-sys crate (https://docs.rs/openssl/0.10.56/openssl/#automatic)
#
# (2) async-tungstenite does not utilise the "vendored" feature for its dependency crates, i.e.
# tokio-native-tls, tungstenite and native-tls. The "vendored" feature would have statically linked
# to a OpenSSL copy instead of dynamically link to the OS' OpenSSL (https://docs.rs/openssl/0.10.56/openssl/#vendored)
# â€” reported an issue here (https://github.com/sdroege/async-tungstenite/issues/119)
#
# (3) We want to use ubuntu:latest (22.04) as the runner image, which (only) has OpenSSL 3.0, because
# OpenSSL 1.1.1 is reaching EOL in Sept 2023 (https://www.openssl.org/blog/blog/2023/03/28/1.1.1-EOL/)
#
# (4) Therefore, we need the builder image to have the same OpenSSL version, else the built binary will
# try to dynamically link to a different (non-existing) version in the runner image
#
# (5) rust:latest is still using bullseye somehow which only has OpenSSL 1.1.1
